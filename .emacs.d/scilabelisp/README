 			      INSTALLATION GUIDE
 ******************************************************************************
 
 In the following:  

    1 - it is assumed that scilab application with version >= 2.5 is already
     	installed on the user environment. To check this one has to run in an xterm
        window:
        scilab 
        and get scilab window.

    2 - SCI environmental variable must be defined and it should point on 
	the main scilab directory.

				opportunity to use gnuserver/client features
  lisp.sci          		- scilab function similar to unix scilab 
				function. It provides capability for scilab 
				run any emacs/lisp commands  directly from 
				scilab shell or any scilab function, under 
	                        condition that scilab-server (which is

 II - INSTALLING SCILAB INTO EMACS/XEMACS
 ****************************************
    1 - Put all *.el files in some directory.

    2 - Put this directory  on your load path into .emacs file. You can do it
	typing into .emacs file the following line:
	(setq load-path (append (list "<your dir" ) load-path))

    2 - Load "scilab-startup" library by typing into your .emacs file:
        (load "scilab-startup")
    
    3 - It is suggested to define $SCIHOME variable which points to the user 
        scilab directory (don't confuse with $SCI directory, which is usually 
        does have write permission) 
    3 - Launch emacs/xemacs with updated .emacs file.

    5 - In emacs/xemacs menu "Tools" you will see three entries related to scilab:
       "Scilab Start"
       "Scilab Setup"
       "Recompile scilab.el"

    6 - Click on "Scilab Setup". If you have problems try to recompile scilab-lisp
       package clicking on "Recompile scilab.el".
    
    7 - You should  get "Customize Group: Scilab Setup" buffer in your emacs/xemacs.
          Go through this buffer and redefine all variables  that have different
          values with your configuration. Most variables are standard and relative
          to your SCI and SCIHOME variables.

    8 - When you finish customization click on [Set for Current Session] in emacs
        or on "Set" button into xemacs. If you are sure that your customization is 
        correct click on [Save for Future Sessions] in emacs or "Save" button into
        xemacs.

    9 -  From "Tools" click on "Scilab Start" or just use short-key if you will see
       it defined from menu. (You can define your own short-key on the setup stage.
       The defualt value is "Ctrl-c s"). You should get scilab shell launched into 
       "*Scilab*" buffer.
     
   10 - If you want to edit some scilab functions just open the corresponding 
        sci/sce file into emacs. You will enter into scilab-edit mode.

   11  - If you want to get help on scilab, then in "Help" menu you can choose
        from "Scilab Topic","Scilab Help" and "Scilab Apropos". You should 
        get the fully clickable help system (not depending either you launch 
        scilb-shell or not)

 III - KNOWN PROBLEMS AND REMARKS
 *******************************

 There is a bug into basic scilab when we try to launch it into emacs/xemacs 
 environment. See BUGS/ directory for the bug reports. I fixed this bug and 
 have build a patch ./PATCHES/scicos-emacs-nw-mode.patch.  The basic scilab
 (vesrion 2.6) has to be recompiled with this patch. To do this:
    1 - Place the above patch into $SCI directory
    2 - Run command:
        patch -p0 < scicos-emacs-nw-mode.patch
    3 - make all

This patch fixes the problem and makes scilab fully featured into emacs/xemacs
environment and also into term when you run "scilab -nw" command.
